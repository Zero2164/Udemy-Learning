  //Intentional absence of any value.
  //Must be assigned.

//Example 1:
//No one is logged in yet...
let loggedInUser = null; //value is explicitly nothing

//A user logs in...
loggedInUser = 'Alan Rickman';



/////////////////////////////////////

//Undefined
  //Variables that do not have an assigned value are undefined.
//Example 1:
