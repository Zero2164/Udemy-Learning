//Comparisons

//greater than 
//less than
//greater than or equal to
//less than or equal to

//Examples:
10 > 1; //true
0.2 > 0.3; //false
-10 < 0; //true
50.5 < 5; //false
0.5 <= 0.5; //true
99 >= 4; //true
99 >= 99; //true

//It is possible to compare strings, there is a unicode order for each character in a string.
'a' < 'b'; //true
'A' > 'a'; //false 


//////////////////////////////////////////////
//Equality

//equality
//not equal
//strict equality
//strict non-equality

//examples:

//double equals (==):
  //double equals checks for equality of value, but not equality of type
  //It coerces both values to the same type and then compares them.
  //This can lead to some unexpected results

//triple equals (===):
 //triple equals checks for equality of value AND type
