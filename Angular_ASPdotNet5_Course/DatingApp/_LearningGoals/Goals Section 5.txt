What are Observables?:

New Standard for managing async data included in ES7 (ES2016).

Introduced in Angular V2

Observables are a lazy collection of multiple values over time

Observables are similar to newsletters:
  - Only subscribers of the newsletter receive the newsletter
  - If no-one subscribes to the newsletter it probably will not be printed

*****************************

Promises VS Observables

Promises:
Provides a single future value
Not lazy
Execution CANNOT be cancelled

Observables:
Emits multiple values over time
Lazy
Execution CAN be cancelled
Can use with various operators - map, filter, reduce, and other operators

*****************************
Getting data from Observables:

Subscribe Method:
-Subscribes to Observable only, however when using any HTTP requests they typically complete automatically, thus unsubscribing is not necessary.

getMembers() {
  this.service.getMembers().subscribe(members => {
    this.members = members
  }, error => {
    console.log(error);
  }, () => {
    console.log('Completed!');
  })
}

ToPromise Method:

getMembers() {
  return this.http.get('api/users).toPromise()
}


Async Pipe Method:
-Automatically Subscribes/Unsubscribes from the Observable

<li *ngFor="let member of service.getMembers() | async">{{member.username}}</li>
